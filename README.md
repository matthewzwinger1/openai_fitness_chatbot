Demo Code for Lifetime

Hey all,
This is a pretty basic POC of a chatbot designed to help people reach their fitness goals. It leverages chainlit, which is a super cool tool to quickly build AI ideas. I made it because I'm super interested in what Lifetime is doing with this and I was bored this last saturday morning.

If this seems cool to y'all and you want to see more, I'm happy to throw this in a larveal framework (event driven w/ react and node). I think that matches the job description right?

You can run it after setting up a python venv (see here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) with: 
```bash
pip install chainlit openai
chainlit run app.py -w
```
However without an openAI api key set up there's not much to see. I sent over a lil demo so give that a look!

Best,

Matthew Zwinger
